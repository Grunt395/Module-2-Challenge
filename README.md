Module 2 Challenge: Professional Portfolio

Module 02 Challenge is about taking the first steps towards creating an online project portfolio to display web development projects. Some projects may be placeholders and will be filled in with newly-created projects from later in the course.

Screenshots of the application can be found in the Screenshots folder in the repository.
